	<h1>Hi there, I'm Ernesto!</h1>
	<p> I am from Mexico City where I obtained a bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics at the Mexico Autonomous Institute of Technology (ITAM). Afterwards, I worked as a research assistant at the National Cancer Institute in Mexico (INCan) and the National Institute of Genomic Medicine (INMEGEN). </p>
	<p> Currently, I am working towards obtaining my doctoral degree in Biostatistics at the University of Washington. My amazing advisros are Drs. Marco Carone and Alex Luedtke. Broadly speaking, my research interests are in the areas of causal inference, and flexible prediction methods in survival outcome settings. Specifically, I have focused on: (i) studying the asymptotic properties of a propensity score matching method and improving its performance; (ii) developing robust prediction methods to predict the risk of HIV-1 infection in a population from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. </p> 
	<p> Additionally, I have been a research assistant at Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute (KPWA) since the start of my PhD training. At KPWA, I have worked with different multidisciplinary teams whose projects are related to vaccine safety surveillance, assessing healthcare interventions to reduce patientsâ€™ risk of not showing to their health appointments, and evaluating potential incentive programs to reduce health plan associated costs of high-price medications.</a></p>
